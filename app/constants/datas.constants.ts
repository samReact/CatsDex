      'The Asian Semi-Longhair is a cat breed similar to the Asian Shorthair except it has semi-long fur. The breed is also known by the name Tiffanie or Tiffany. It is recognized in any of the Asian Shorthair or Burmese colors and patterns. Like the Asian Shorthair, the breed was developed in Asia and is not currently recognized by any U.S. Registries. It has full recognition in the GCCF. It is related to, and in some registries distinct from, the Chantilly-Tiffany or Foreign Longhair, the North American variant.',

      'The American Bobtail is an uncommon breed of domestic cat which was developed in the late 1960s. It is most notable for its stubby "bobbed" tail about one-third to one-half the length of a normal cat\'s tail. This is the result of a cat body type genetic mutation affecting the tail development, similar to that of a Manx cat. The breed is not related to the Japanese Bobtail despite the similar name and physical type—the breeding programs are entirely unrelated, and the genetic mutation causing the bobbed tail are known to be different because the mutation causing the American Bobtail\'s tail is dominant, whereas the Japanese Bobtail tail mutation is recessive.',

      'The Persian cat is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by its round face and short muzzle. It is also known as the "Persian Longhair" in the English-speaking countries. In the Middle East region, they are widely known as "Shirazi cats" and in Iran they are known as "Shiraz cat". The first documented ancestors of the Persian were imported into Italy from Iran around 1620. Recognized by the cat fancy since the late 19th century, it was developed first by the English, and then mainly by American breeders after the Second World War. Some cat fancier organizations\' breed standards subsume the Himalayan and Exotic Shorthair as variants of this breed, while others treat them as separate breeds.',
